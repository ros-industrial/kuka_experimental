# Configuring EKI on the controller

This guide highlights the steps needed in order to successfully configure the **EKI interface** on the controller to work with the **kuka_eki_hw_interface** on your PC with ROS.

## 1. Controller network configuration

Windows runs behind the SmartHMI on the teach pad. Make sure that the **Windows interface** of the controller and the **PC with ROS** is connected to the same subnet.

1. Log in as **Expert** or **Administrator** on the teach pad and navigate to **Network configuration** (**Start-up > Network configuration > Activate advanced configuration**).
2. There should already be an interface checked out as the **Windows interface**. For example:
   * **IP**: `192.168.1.121`
   * **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`
   * **Default gateway**: `192.168.1.121`
   * **Windows interface checkbox** should be checked.
3. Make note of the above IP address as you will need it later.
4. (Optional) Run **cmd.exe** and ping the PC you want to communicate with on the same subnet (e.g. 192.168.1.10).  If your **PC** has an IP address on the same subnet as the **Windows interface** on the controller, the controller should receive answers from the PC.

## 2. KRL Files

The files included in the `kuka_eki_hw_interface/krl` folder provide the KRL interface and Ethernet packet configurations.  The XML files need to be modified to work for your specific configuration:

##### EkiHwInterface.xml
1. Edit the `IP` tag so that it corresponds to the IP address (`address.of.robot.controller`) corresponding to the **Windows interface** of the controller (noted earlier).
2. Keep the `PORT` tag as it is (`54600`) or change it if you want to use another port (must be in the range of `54600` to `54615`).

Note that the `eki/robot_address` and `eki/robot_port` parameters of the `kuka_eki_hw_interface` must correspond to the `IP`and `PORT` set in this XML file.

##### Copy files to controller
The files `kuka_eki_hw_interface.dat` and `kuke_eki_hw_interface.src` should not be edited. All files are now ready to be copied to the Kuka controller.  Using WorkVisual or a USB drive (with appropriate privleges):

1. Copy `kuka_eki_hw_interface.dat` and `kuka_eki_hw_interface.src` files to `KRC:\R1\Program`.
2. Copy `EkiHwInterface.xml` to `C:\KRC\ROBOTER\Config\User\Common\EthernetKRL\`.

## 3. Configure the kuka_eki_hw_interface
The **kuka_eki_hw_interface** needs to be configured in order to successfully communicate with EKI on the controller. Inside `/kuka_eki_hw_interface/test` and `/kuka_eki_hw_interface/config` in this repository is a set of `*.yaml` files. These configuration files may be loaded into a launch-file used to start the **kuka_eki_hw_interface** with correct parameters, such as:

* **Joint names** corresponding to the robot description (URDF or .xacro).
* **IP addresses** and **port numbers** corresponding to the EKI setup specified via the above XML files.

We recommend that you copy the configuration files, edit the copies for your needs and use these files to create your own launch file. A template will be provided at a later time. However, at this time, have a look at `test_hardware_interface.launch`, `test_params.yaml`, `controller_joint_names.yaml` and `hardware_controllers.yaml` to achieve a working test-launch.

In order to successfully launch the **kuka_eki_hw_interface** a parameter `robot_description` needs to be present on the ROS parameter server. This parameter can be set manually or by adding this line inside the launch file (replace support package and .xacro to match your application):

```xml
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro '$(find kuka_kr6_support)/urdf/kr6r900sixx.xacro'"/>
```

Make sure that the line is added before the `kuka_eki_hw_interface` itself is loaded.

##### Command Buffering Setup
The driver currently limits the number of queued joint targets to prevent unbounded trajectory lag (error) that can occur when sufficiently dense target trajectories (temporal and/or spatial) are requested.  The size of the buffer is set via the parameter `eki/max_cmd_buf_len`.  When not present, the buffer defaults to five (5), which is the maximum number of instructions allowed in the controller's advance run (i.e., KRC internal interpolator lookahead).

With the buffering active, overly dense trajectory points are dropped with the result being small and bounded trajectory lag at the expense of some positional deviation (dropped waypoints are not strictly enforced).  For paths that require exact positional accuracy buffering can be disabled by setting the limit to a sufficiently large number (e.g., 512) with the caveat that dense trajectories might result in low-than-requested velocity and subsequent time lag.  In other words, the buffering limit can be seen as a tradeoff between positional accuracy and time accuracy.

## 4. Testing
At this point you are ready to test the EKI interface. Before the test, make sure that:

* You have specified the `eki/robot_address` and `eki/robot_port` of the **kuka_eki_hw_interface** to correspond with the KRL files on the controller.
* You have a launch-file loading the network parameters, robot description, kuka_hw_interface, hardware controller and controller joint names.

The next steps describe how to launch the test file:

* On the robot, start the servers

1. On the teach pad, enter mode **T1** for testing purposes.
2. Navigate to `KRC:\R1\Program` and select `kuka_eki_hw_interface.src`.
3. Press and hold an enabling switch and the run/play-button. The robot will release its breaks and a message like **Programmed path reached (BCO)** will be shown at the teach pad.
4. Press and hold again. The robot is now waiting for clients to connect.

* On your ROS PC, in a new terminal:

```
$ roscore
```

* Open a new terminal and roslaunch the previously configured launch-file:

```
$ roslaunch kuka_eki_hw_interface test_hardware_interface.launch
```

The **kuka_eki_hw_interface** is now connected and streaming commands.

6. In a new terminal:

```
$ rosrun rqt_joint_trajectory_controller rqt_joint_trajectory_controller
```

Choose **controller manager ns** and **controller** and you should be able to move each robot joint.

* Note that T1-mode limits the robot movement velocity and is intended for testing purposes.
