# Parameters for use with IK solvers which support OPW (Ortho-Parallel Wrist)
# kinematic configurations, as described in the paper "An Analytical Solution
# of the Inverse Kinematics Problem of Industrial Serial Manipulators with an
# Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist" by Mathias Brandst√∂tter, Arthur
# Angerer, and Michael Hofbaur (Proceedings of the Austrian Robotics Workshop
# 2014, 22-23 May, 2014, Linz, Austria).
#
# The moveit_opw_kinematics_plugin package provides such a solver.
